In The Beginning:
    - Floats were heavily used to design web pages.
    - Then bootstrap came out with their grid system.
    - Later on CSS Flexbox was created as an even easier way to build UI layouts.
        - CSS Grid is also used to build UI layouts.

Flexbox:
    - The 'flex' value is set via the **display** property.
    - Flexbox replaces floats & it's much more elegant to work with.
    - You can align items horizontally (rows) or vertically (columns).
    - Flex items can be reordered via CSS.

How To Use:
    - Declare 'display: flex' to create a flex container.
    - All direct child elements will then be considered 'flex items'.

Flexbox Layout:
    - Main axis (x) & Cross axis (y).
    - justify-content -> align along the main axis (horizontal).
    - align-items -> align items along the cross axis (vertical).
    - align-content -> align when there's extra space in the cross axis (vertical).
